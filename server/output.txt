Manchester City will stay top of the Premier League going into the September international break after beating Fulham on Saturday thanks to an Erling Haaland hat-trick.

City were the only side with a 100 per cent record going into the fourth week of the new season, and remain top by two points with a 5-1 win over Fulham at the Etihad. Fulham will feel aggrieved after conceding a controversial goal on the stroke of half-time, but had no answer to City's power after the break.

Juanma Lillo was in City's dugout once again as Pep Guardiola recovers from back surgery, having led City to a comeback victory over Sheffield United last weekend. Manuel Akanji and Phil Foden returned to the starting line up, but Jack Grealish was missing after suffering a thigh injury.

City were sloppy in the first half but Haaland teed up Julian Alvarez to open the scoring. 90 seconds later Fulham were level as Tim Ream tapped in from a corner. Nathan Ake had the Blues ahead in stoppage time, although Manu Akanji looked clearly offside as the ball passed him to go into the corner. After the break, Haaland netted a hat-trick to ensure that controversial call had no bearing on the result.
